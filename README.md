# stats
This repository is for my class materials that go alongside the OpenIntro Statistics textbook.

For now, many of the slides are unaltered versions from OpenIntro https://github.com/OpenIntroOrg/openintro-statistics-slides
Also, it should be clear that I am NOT affiliated with the OpenIntro organization, and I am doing my best to honor their copyright. 

The original OpenIntro textbook and its no-margin version, are both hosted here in their unaltered forms.
