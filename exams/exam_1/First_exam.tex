\begin{questions}
\question[10] Samuel suspects that coffee impairs short-term memory. Samuel runs a study by asking random BHCC students to participate in a memory challenge: repeating back 7 random digits. Samuel marks whether the participant successfully repeated the digits. Then, Samuel asks the participant whether they had coffee in the last 3 hours. The results are summarized below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c|c}
          & success & fail & total \\ \hline
coffee    &  16   & 7      & 23   \\
no coffee &  11   & 4      & 15   \\ \hline
total     &  27   & 11     & 38
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{parts}
\part What kind of study was this?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice experimental
\choice observational
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\part Which group performed better (had a higher proportion of success)?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice coffee
\choice no coffee
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\part Which hypothesis is the null hypothesis?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice The difference in proportions is due to chance.
\choice The difference in proportions is due to an association between coffee and memory.
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\part Which hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice The difference in proportions is due to chance.
\choice The difference in proportions is due to an association between coffee and memory.
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\part Would you reject the null hypothesis? Why?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice Yes. The difference seems too large for chance.
\choice No. The difference seems small enough to be just from chance.

\question[8] From the guitar prices, a random sample of size 15 was taken. Those 15 prices are listed below.

\question[9] A machine cuts rods to 30 centimeters. However, the machine is not perfect, so the actual lengths have variability. 

Let the continuous random variable $Y$ represent the length of a rod. An engineer determines $Y$ approximately follows the distribution shown by the density function below. The entire area under the curve is 100\%, and each square is worth 1\%.

\part Estimate the probability a rod is cut to a length between 30.2 centimeters and 30.4 centimeters?
\\ In other words, evaluate $P(30.2 < Y < 30.4)$.
\vfill
\part Estimate $Q_1$, the 25th percentile. Answers within $\pm 0.02$ will count.
