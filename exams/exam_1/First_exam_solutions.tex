\begin{questions}
\question[10] Samuel suspects that coffee impairs short-term memory. Samuel runs a study by asking random BHCC students to participate in a memory challenge: repeating back 7 random digits. Samuel marks whether the participant successfully repeated the digits. Then, Samuel asks the participant whether they had coffee in the last 3 hours. The results are summarized below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c|c}
          & success & fail & total \\ \hline
coffee    &  16   & 7      & 23   \\
no coffee &  11   & 4      & 15   \\ \hline
total     &  27   & 11     & 38
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{parts}
\part What kind of study was this?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice experimental
\CorrectChoice observational
\end{checkboxes}
\begin{solution}
There was no assignment to groups.
\end{solution}

\part Which group performed better (had a higher proportion of success)?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice coffee
\CorrectChoice no coffee
\end{checkboxes}
\begin{solution} You need to find the proportion of each group.
$$\frac{16}{23} = 0.696$$
$$\frac{11}{15} = 0.733$$
\end{solution}

\part Which hypothesis is the null hypothesis?
\begin{checkboxes}
\CorrectChoice The difference in proportions is due to chance.
\choice The difference in proportions is due to an association between coffee and memory.
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\part Which hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice The difference in proportions is due to chance.
\CorrectChoice The difference in proportions is due to an association between coffee and memory.
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\part Would you reject the null hypothesis? Why?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice Yes. The difference seems too large for chance.
\CorrectChoice No. The difference seems small enough to be just from chance.
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\end{parts}

\begin{solution} With enough thought, these choices should give you the answers to the previous two questions...

\question[8] When ``acoustic guitar'' was searched on craigslist, there were 144 local postings that included a price.  These prices are displayed as a histogram.
\vspace{-0.3in}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{figures/guitars.pdf}

\begin{parts}

\part Which of the following would be an appropriate estimate of the median?
\\\begin{oneparcheckboxes}
\choice \$1
\CorrectChoice \$200
\choice \$500
\choice \$3500
\end{oneparcheckboxes}
\begin{solution}
The class 0-200 has almost exactly 72 prices, which is half of the 144 prices. You could have also seen the 15-price sample has a similar median.
\end{solution}

\part Which of the following would be an appropriate estimate of the mean?
\\\begin{oneparcheckboxes}
\choice \$1
\choice \$200
\CorrectChoice \$500
\choice \$3500
\end{oneparcheckboxes}
\begin{solution}
We know the mean should be higher than the median because of the right skew. Also, you could have used the 15-price sample to inform this. 
\end{solution}

\part Which of the following would be an appropriate estimate of the standard deviation?
\\\begin{oneparcheckboxes}
\choice \$1
\choice \$20
\CorrectChoice \$700
\choice \$3500
\end{oneparcheckboxes}
\begin{solution}
Standard deviation is approximately the average deviation from the mean. It can also be thought of as a typical amount of spread. The standard deviation is often about 1/6 of the range. You could have also calculated the standard deviation of the 15-price sample. 
\end{solution}

\part Which option best describes this histogram?
\begin{checkboxes}
\choice Skew-left
\CorrectChoice Skew-right
\choice Superstitious
\choice Symmetric

\question[8] From the guitar prices, a random sample of size 15 was taken. Those 15 prices are listed below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c}
10&20&60&60&75&85&125&150&220&250&275&700&1395&1800&2000
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\\
Make a boxplot summarizing these data. Be sure to indicate $Q_1$, $Q_3$, median, outliers, and ends of whiskers. The axis below is meant to help you. 

\begin{solution}
median = 150 ; Q1 = 60 ; Q3 = 700 ; IQR = 640 \\
check for outliers:
\\ 60-1.5*640 = -900
\\ 700+1.5*640 = 1660
\end{solution}

\question[9] Let random variable $X$ represent the number of tails showing when four fair coins are flipped. The probability distribution of $X$ is shown below, where $x_i$ represents the $i$th possible value of $X$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
$x_i$ & $P(X=x_i)$ \\ \hline
0 & 0.0625 \\
1 & 0.25 \\
2 & 0.375 \\
3 & 0.25 \\
4 & 0.0625 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{parts}
\part What is the probability of 2 tails? In other words, evaluate $P(X=2)$.
\begin{solution} 
$$0.375$$
\end{solution}
\vfill
\part What is the probability of at least 2 tails? In other words, evaluate $P(X \ge 2)$.
\begin{solution} 
$$0.375 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = \fbox{0.6875}$$
\end{solution}
\vfill
\part What is the probability of more than 2 tails? In other words, evaluate $P(X > 2)$.
\begin{solution} 
$$0.25 + 0.0625 = \fbox{0.3125}$$
\end{solution}
\vfill
\bonuspart[2] Determine $x$ such that $P(X<x)=0.9375$ and $P(X > x)=0$.
\begin{solution} 
Notice that $$P(X<4) = 0.0625+0.25+0.375+0.25 = 0.9375 $$
and
$$P(X>4) = 0 $$
Thus, $$x=4$$

\question[9] A machine cuts rods to 30 centimeters. However, the machine is not perfect, so the actual lengths have variability. 

Let the continuous random variable $Y$ represent the length of a rod. An engineer determines $Y$ approximately follows the distribution shown by the density function below. The entire area under the curve is 100\%, and each square is worth 1\%.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{figures/norm2.png}
\end{center}
\begin{parts}
\part Estimate the probability a rod is cut to exactly 30.2 centimeters.\\ In other words, estimate $P(Y=30.2)$.
\begin{solution} 
A continuous random variable will never exactly hit a specific number. Remember, we find areas to find probabilities. A rectangle with no width has no area.
$$0$$
\end{solution}
\part Estimate the probability a rod is cut to a length between 30.2 centimeters and 30.4 centimeters?
\\ In other words, evaluate $P(30.2 < Y < 30.4)$.
\begin{solution} 
If you count the squares under the curve from 30.2 until 30.4, you should count about 13 or 14 squares (I guess 12 is fine too).
$$13\% ~\text{or}~ 14\%$$
\end{solution}
\part Estimate $Q_1$, the 25th percentile. Answers within $\pm 0.02$ will count.
\\In other words, estimate $Q_1$ such that $P(Y < Q_1)=0.25$.
\begin{solution} 
Start counting from the left until you reach 25\%. Your answer should be between 29.85 and 29.90.
\end{solution}
