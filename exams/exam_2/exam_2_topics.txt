Area under standard normal distribution

Normal probabilities (need to find z scores)

Comparing unusualness (normal)

Finding percentile scores/cutoff scores
    IQR

Finding standard deviation from two scores' percentiles
    mean = a
    75th percentile = b
    normal

    Used to judge normalness (along with QQ plots)
