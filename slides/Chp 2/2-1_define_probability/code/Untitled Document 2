Probability:
    P(A)
    0 <= P(A) <= 1

Events are mutually exclusive IFF:
    P(A and B) = 0
Events are independent IFF:
    P(A)*P(B) = P(A and B)
Events are exhausive IFF:
    P(A or B) = 1

A and B are complementary 
    IFF 
A and B are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive
    which implies
B = A^c




P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B|A)
