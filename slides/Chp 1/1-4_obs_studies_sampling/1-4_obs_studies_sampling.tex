\item \hl{Retrospective studies} collect data after events have taken place.
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Researchers reviewing past events in medical records.

\subsection{Sampling strategies}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Obtaining good samples}

\begin{itemize}

\item Almost all statistical methods are based on the notion of implied randomness. 

\item If observational data are not collected in a random framework from a population, these statistical methods -- the estimates and errors associated with the estimates -- are not reliable.

\item Most commonly used random sampling techniques are \hl{simple}, \hl{stratified}, and \hl{cluster} sampling.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Simple random sample}

Randomly select cases from the population, where there is no implied connection between the points that are selected.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{1-4_obs_studies_sampling/figures/sampling_methods/simple}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Stratified sample}

\hl{Strata} are made up of similar observations. We take a simple random sample from \underline{each} stratum.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{1-4_obs_studies_sampling/figures/sampling_methods/stratified}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Cluster sample}

\hl{Clusters} are usually not made up of homogeneous observations. We take a simple random sample of clusters, and then sample \underline{all} observations in that cluster. Usually preferred for economical reasons.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{1-4_obs_studies_sampling/figures/sampling_methods/cluster}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multistage sample}

\hl{Clusters} are usually not made up of homogeneous observations.  We take a simple random sample of clusters, and then take a simple random sample of observations from the sampled clusters.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{1-4_obs_studies_sampling/figures/sampling_methods/multistage}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Practice}

\pq{A city council has requested a household survey be conducted in a suburban area of their city. The area is broken into many distinct and unique neighborhoods, some including large homes, some with only apartments. Which approach would likely be the \emph{least} effective?}
