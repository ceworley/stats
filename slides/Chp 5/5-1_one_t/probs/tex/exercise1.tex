\begin{question}
You are given the following hypotheses: \[H_0:~~ \mu = 12\]
\[H_A:~~ \mu < 12\] We know that the sample standard deviation is 0.205
and the sample size is 20. For what sample mean would the \(p\)-value be
equal to 0.005? Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are
satisfied.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Determine the degrees of freedom. \[df = 19 \] From the \(p\)-value we
find a \(t\) score from the \(t\) table. In this case, our \(p\)-value
is a one-tail probability. \[t = -2.86 \] We calculate the standard
error. \[SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.205}{\sqrt{20}} = 0.0458 \]
We calculate the sample mean that would give \(p\text{-value} = 0.005\).
\[\bar{x} = \mu+t\cdot SE = 12+(-2.86)(0.0458) = 11.9 \]
\end{solution}
