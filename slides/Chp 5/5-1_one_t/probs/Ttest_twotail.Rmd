Question
========

You will perform a single-sample $t$ test of the null hypothesis claiming $\mu=`r mu`$. Before collecting the sample, you decide to use a two-tail test with a significance level $\alpha = `r alpha`$.  The sample has the following attributes:
$$\begin{aligned}
n &=& `r n` \\
\bar{x} &=& `r xbar` \\
s &=& `r s`
\end{aligned}$$
What is your conclusion?

Answerlist
----------
* Reject the null hypothesis
* Retain the null hypothesis


Solution
========

We state the hypotheses:
$$H_0:~~\mu = `r mu` $$
$$H_A:~~\mu \ne `r mu` $$
We estimate the standard error (same way as with $z$ testing).
$$SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} =  \frac{`r s`}{\sqrt{`r n`}} = `r se`$$
We calculate the $t$ score (same way as with $z$ testing).
$$|t| = \left|\frac{`r xbar`-`r mu`}{`r se`}\right| = `r t` $$
We determine the degrees of freedom.
$$df = n-1 = `r n-1` $$
We estimate the $p$-value from the $T$ table.
$$`r lb` < p\text{-value} < `r ub` $$
We compare the $p$-value to $\alpha$.
$$p\text{-value} `r sym` \alpha $$
We make our conclusion: we `r wrd` the null.
