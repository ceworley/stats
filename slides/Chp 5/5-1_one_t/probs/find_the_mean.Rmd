Question
========

You are given the following hypotheses:
$$H_0:~~ \mu = `r mu`$$
$$H_A:~~ \mu `r sym` `r mu`$$
We know that the sample standard deviation is `r s` and the sample size is `r n`. For what sample mean would the $p$-value be equal to `r pval`? Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.


Solution
========

Determine the degrees of freedom.
$$df = `r n-1` $$
From the $p$-value we find a $t$ score from the $t$ table. In this case, our $p$-value is a one-tail probability.
$$t = `r t` $$
We calculate the standard error.
$$SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{`r s`}{\sqrt{`r n`}} = `r se` $$
We calculate the sample mean that would give $p\text{-value} = `r pval`$.
$$\bar{x} = \mu+t\cdot SE = `r mu`+(`r t`)(`r se`) = `r x` $$
