Now, imagine we sample from a new population/distribution, but we don't know the population parameters. What can we conclude?

\soln{Well, our point estimate is $$\mu \approx \bar{x} = 26.4$$
However, we want to also describe our uncertainty. To me, based on the previous slide, I'd guess the uncertainty is about $\pm 1/10$ of the range?
$$\mu = 26.4 \pm 5 $$
